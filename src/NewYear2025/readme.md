### All the problems of DSA

**1. Print Anagrams Together**  [Problem link 🔗](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-anagrams-together/1)
> **Logic:** anagrams are combinations of parent string. Don't need to be generated all the possible anagrams.
>> Examples: "cat" ➡️ cat ➡️ tac ➡️ act ➡️ atc ➡️   cta ➡️ tca. If we sort the `cat` ➡️ act. now we can say act is the main key of all anagrams of cat.
> 
> Logic is simple. just generate this key and put all the string that are anagram of  `key`. return it
