# ➡️ Day2 of learning recursion and my some thought process 💀

I am  starting my Learning Linkedlist journey from yesterday. Today I  learnt some fundamental things in linked-list. which are created own linked-list class , insertion , deletion , traversal and reverse a linked-list.

📂 I am was fool because i just thought theory is not important, but when was created my own linked-list class, theory and fundamentals are seriously helped  me a lot.

🐒 If you want master any data-structure then first focus on fundamental and theory. this is for today🐒

# ➡️ Day3 of learning recursion and my some thought process 💀

🛜 Today I am excited to share my linked-list learning process with us. 🧨 Today I have done some  questions i mentioned below:

1. Reverse a linked-list using recursion.🏷️
2. Detect cycle in linked-list.🧨
3. IsCycle exist and calculate nodes from the  loop.
4. Arrange oddAndEvenList.

Today I am so tired, I can't explain the hole process today, so stay  stuned for next day.
